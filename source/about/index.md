[wearther][]'s blazingly fast optimizer takes many variables into account when performing calculations: wind speed, humidity, and a weighted average apparent temperatures for the next few hours.

The default duration setting -- *long* -- takes the weighted average apparent temperature for the next 6 to 12 hours; it works great if you are planning to be outside for the whole day. Otherwise, use -- *short* --  duration if you are planning to be outside for a short period of time (up to 2 to 3 hours).
