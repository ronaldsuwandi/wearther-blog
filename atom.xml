    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good news! We&#39;ve implemented some new features on <a href="http://wearther.cc" target="_blank">wearther</a>!</p>
<img src="/img/2013/12/umbrella.png" class="l-screenshot" width="300" height="300" title="Is that an umbrella? Yes it is!">


<ul>
<li>Umbrella icon! It might not look exciting but this is a very useful feature that has been missing from <a href="http://wearther.cc" target="_blank">wearther</a> for quite some time. The icon will display if there is a chance of rain in the next few hours (depending on the duration settings)</li>
</ul>
<img src="/img/2013/12/shop.png" class="l-screenshot" width="600" height="500">


<ul>
<li><p><em>Shop shop shop</em>! We are very excited with this new feature. At the moment you are able to view listings for the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>cotton blazer</li>
<li>wool blazer</li>
<li>cotton shirt</li>
<li>cotton jeans</li>
<li>cotton chino</li>
<li>cotton sneakers</li>
<li>leather shoes</li>
</ul>
<p>We manually picked the items from various stores and brands which we hope you will enjoy. It was very labor-intensive work but we believe that it&#39;s worth the effort. Stay tuned for more clothing items!</p>
</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We recently took notice that wearther was not proving the right clothing combinations when temperatures were greater than 27 °C / 80 °F. We quickly realized that it was due to the formula of one of the temperature indicators that we currently use - Apparent Temperature. Because of this, wearther was providing us with combinations that involved too many layers of clothing.</p>
<p>As of current, wearther makes use of the <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/info/thermal_stress/" target="_blank">Australian Apparent Temperature</a> which takes into account wind speed. This works great but we missed out on the fact that it was meant to be used during cooler and not warmer temperatures. As a result we improved on the Apparent Temperature formula to include the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index#Formula" target="_blank">Heat Index</a> to represent warmer temperatures, while keeping the AAT for cooler temperatures.</p>
<p>As spring has arrived in the southern hemisphere, we believe that this change will make wearther more relevant to our friends in the northern and southern hemispheres.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>New version of <a href="http://wearther.cc" target="_blank">wearther</a> (0.2.0) is now up and running with some new features including</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic default unit detection. <em>Hooray!</em> It will use default unit based on your current location (eg. in the US Fahrenheit and MPH will be used and in Australia, Celsius and KM/H)</li>
<li>Wind speed and temperature units can be set separately. You can use Fahrenheit for temperature and KM/H for wind speed if you wish</li>
</ul>
<img src="/img/2013/10/wearther-0.2.0-settings.png" class="l-screenshot" width="300" height="300">


<ul>
<li>A Combination of arrow buttons on larger screens (ie. tablets and desktops). We received feedback that dragging the clothing combinations on larger screens was not very intuitive.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/img/2013/10/wearther-0.2.0-laptop.png" class="l-screenshot">


<ul>
<li>Options for the time duration spent outside. By default wearther takes The weighted average temperature for the next 6-12 hours (<code>Long</code> duration) before deciding what sort of clothing combinations to display. With <code>Short</code> duration now included as an alternative option, it will take the weighted average temperature for the next 2-3 hours to derive an optimal clothing combination. Perfect if you are only planning to go out for a short while</li>
<li>Reduced bandwidth usage by 50%</li>
<li>Minor UI changes (color, option back button, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us know what you think! We still have plenty of other features that need to be implemented and we are very excited about it! :D</p>
